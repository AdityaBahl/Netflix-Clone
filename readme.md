## To Run

https://adityabahl.github.io/Netflix-Clone/

(Note: For some reason, a warning may appear that the site is dangerous, it is due to faulty algorithm from Google's end, as this site is not a usual website but just for demonstration purposes, dont worry, please proceed when prompted!)

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS

## Why Netflix Clone?

There are a number of reasons to create a Netflix clone:

1. Educational or learning purposes- to gain a deeper understanding of how the platform works and how it is built.
2. Serves as an exercise in software development- helping to improve skills in areas such as user experience design, database management, and scalability.
3. To provide similar service in certain regions where Netflix is not available, or creating a new business model with their own brand.

## Challenges and limitations

Some of the main challenges include:

1. Content acquisition: Netflix has spent billions of dollars on acquiring the rights to a large and diverse library of content. It would be difficult and costly for a clone to acquire similar content rights.

2. User experience and interface design: Netflix has a highly polished and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. Creating a clone that is equally user-friendly would be a significant challenge.

3. Scalability: Netflix handles a large number of concurrent users and streams, and creating a clone that can handle the same level of traffic would be a technical challenge.

4. Security: Netflix implements robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to content. Implementing similar security measures in a clone would be a major challenge.

5. Legal and copyright issues: as a replica of a popular service, it could be facing legal issues with copyright infringement, and intellectual property rights.

6. Cost: Building a platform like Netflix is a huge undertaking that requires a large amount of resources and funding.

Additionally, there are limitations on a clone which Netflix already has, like the user data, and the audience, that clone would not have the same advantages, and would start from scratch.

Hence, to avoid all that, this project just tries to emulate the front-end aspect of the website.

## Conclusion

I learned many new techniques and enjoyed the process. There were a lot of problems, but
removing errors is what we must learn. I will explore this domain further.
